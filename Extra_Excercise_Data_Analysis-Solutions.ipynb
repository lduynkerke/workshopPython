    "Suppose we want to measure the acceleration of $g$ due to gravity. This can be calculated by dropping a weight from a known distance and measuring the fall time. In this assignment you will learn how to estimate the error in such a measurement. Among the many sources of error, one clear one is the error in determining the fall time. Lets say we are using a stop watch where the start and stop time were recorded by a human pushing the button.\n",

    "How would this work? Well, one way would be to have two signals that we know are exactly 10 seconds apart, and have one person use the stopwatch to try to measure the time, and then compare this to the known value. And, of course, since the exact time the person with the stopwatch measures might vary from one run of the experiment to the next, you would want to repeat this many times to get some statistics and take a look at the distribution of the measured results. From this distribution, you can then say concrete things about the uncertainty in the measured time. \n",

If I really want to build a distribution, I would want to have **A LOT** of samples: here below we will look at 1000 different repetition of the same experiment! (This sound painful, but could be done by having a group of 100 students repeat the same timing measurement 10 times.)\n",
