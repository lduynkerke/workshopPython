    " It would seem that the function would refer to the global variable `a` and therefore change it's value. However, it is tricky since we first use `a` in the function in an assignment. An assignment in python will automatically create a variable if it does not exist, and so python creates a new variable named `a` in the local scope. The name `a` inside the function now refers to this newly created local variable, and therefore the global variable will not be changed. In fact, this guarantees that you cannot change global variables inside a function, unless you use the `global` qualifier shown in the next example."

    "Note that in general, it is considered bad programming practice to use (too many) global variables. Why? When you write longer and bigger sections of code, it is easier to understand what is going in in your function if your function uses only local variables and communicates back and forth using input parameter and return variables. Using too many global variables in a function can be confusing because they are defined in a different place in your code and so you don't have a good oversight of them.
