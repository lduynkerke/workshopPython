    "In this course, you will work using a platform called \"Jupyter Notebooks\". Jupyter notebooks are a way to combine formatted text (like the text you are reading now), Python code (which you will use below), and the result of your code and calculations all in one place. Go through these notebooks and run the examples. Try to understand their functioning and, if necessary, add code (such as print statements or variable overviews) to make it clear for you. In addition, there are exercises and practice cells where you can program for yourself. Don't be afraid to start coding yourself, writing code and making mistakes is the best way to learn Python.\n",

    "After completing this notebook, you are able to:\n",
    "* start the python interpreter and run code in a notebook\n",
    "* stop and start notebook kernels\n",
    "* create variables\n",
    "* use `%whos` to list the variables stored in the memory of the python kernel\n",
    "* determine the type of a variable \n",
    "* convert between different variable types (float, int, etc)\n",
    "* collect user input using the `input()` command\n",
    "* print variable values using the `print()` command\n",
    "* use list, tuples and np.arrays and understand the differences\n",

If ony one matches, it will automatically type the rest for you. If multiple things match, it will offer you a list: you can either keep typing until it's unique and type tab again, or you can use the cursor keys to select the one you want.\n",
